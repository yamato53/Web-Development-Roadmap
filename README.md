# web-development-roadmap

A simple collection of beginner guides for those who want to learn web development.

>**Note:** I will continue to expand on this guide with links, tools, tutorials and insights that I find helpful for aspiring programmers (and myself!).

# Getting Started

For starters, I'd recommend taking a look at the broad overview of web development. I've found this resource, [Front End Handbook](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/), to be the most comprehensive breakdown of front-end web development. While it doesn’t provide direct links to resources on a lot of things, it lays out exactly what you need to know and even recommends the order in which to begin learning.
  
Don’t get overwhelmed looking at the list, it’s easier than it looks and you’ll pick up a lot of it along the way.
That being said, here's my personal recommendation on where to begin:

1. **HTML
2. **CSS
3. **Browser Developer Tools
4. **The DOM** (How websites are sctructured by the browser)
5. **JavaScript Basics

Learning HTML, CSS and your browser's development tools is fairly easy, and fundamental in your journey towards building websites. 

Heck, by just fiddling around with Chrome's Dev Tools I was able to have a fairly solid understanding of HTML and CSS before I even took classes on them.


> **Note:** A lot of the content here is going to overlap - that's a good thing. You'll likely find yourself repeating the very basics of web development (particularly JS) over and over until you finally have those key lightbulb moment. That same "Aha!" moment will happen again and again until you finally have a firm grasp on the subjects at hand.

# What You’ll Need

There’s a large variety of tools available that make writing code and keeping your projects organized. You'll commonly hear these referred to as IDEs (Independent Development Environments) or code editors. An IDE can have a big impact on how comfortable you are while coding, so make sure to try out a few different options to find what works best for you.


Personally, I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as this is the industry standard with over 63% of programmers using in for both their professional and personal projects. If you want something a bit less complex and heavy-duty, here's a few other options to check out.

- **Atom
- **Sublime Text
- **Xcode
- **Eclipse

If you just need a simple browser-based code editor, try one of these tools.

- **Codepen** (online code editor)
- **JSfiddle** (online code editor)

# HTML

Starting with the easiest of the "core three" skills, we have HTML. I always recommend Codecademy to total beginners as they do a good job holding your hand through the very basics of HTML within a contained environment (you write all the code within their site). Of course, if you already have a bit of HTML know-how, I'd suggest skipping this and going straight to [Interneting is Hard](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/).

- [Codecademy HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)

While Codecademy isn't the best place to learn how all of these different puzzle pieces link together, it does do a great job laying out the basic foundation for you.

# CSS

Here's where things start to get fun. CSS is what makes websites look more exciting than just boring pages of black serif text on white backgrounds. CSS lets you change the font styles, colors, layout, animation of your site, just to name a few. CSS is definitely the most fun part of web development, so let's get started! 

Again, I recommend Codecademy’s tutorials if you're a total beginner, as they do a good job guiding you step-by-step without overloading you with too much information.

- [Codecademy CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)

After you’ve finished with Codecademy's tutorials, head on over to this short series of tutorials. You'll learn more in-depth how HTML and CSS files hook together to build a good looking website. Aside from teaching great fundamental skills, they also touch on some web development best-practices that will save you from many of the most common mistakes beginner devs make.

- [Interneting is Hard](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/)

## CSS - Learn Flexbox

Flexbox is the foundation for modern web development and allows for easy manipulation of block elements. Here's a great tutorial on how exactly flexbox works.

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

If you ever need a reminder on how a certain flexbox element works, there's a fantastic Codepen playground setup to test different styles.

# JavaScript

JavaScript is where things start to get interesting, as this is where you'll finally start learning the actual *programming* language of web development. As such, this is likely where you'll spend the longest time learning material, building projects and writing code. Programming is tough! But don't let that discourage you. Start out with small steps and really do your best to understand the concepts presented to you before moving on.

Now, it's quite likely that programming is fundamentally different than anything you've learned before, so take your time! If you get stuck, don't skip by. Learning how to develop solutions and persevere over difficult challenges is what sets apart great programmers from the bad ones. As such, honing your puzzle solving skills is critical to your life as a dev.

With that said, I’d start here.

- [Codecademy JS Basics](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

Yet again, Codecademy is a decent resource for absolute beginners that won’t scare you away with advanced programming concepts. For now, just learn the syntax and don’t worry about how your code will actually be implemented in the real world.

Next, do this series of videos, they are by-far the best series of tutorials I’ve found that teaches you real-world application of the JS syntax and code you'll be writing.

- [Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript)

After you’ve finished the series, I recommend reading the Eloquent JS ebook. He does a good job explaining the computer science behind JS without overloading you with too much random jargon.

- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

After that, I’d read this series of ebooks, it’s fantastic about grilling in some of the really complicated things about JS.

- [You Don't Know JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

# Node

Node is the compiler that allows JavaScript to actually run. You don’t really need to learn about this until much later, but it doesn’t hurt to know what it actually is, as you'll be hearing the name a lot.

This is a good, simple breakdown of what node is.

- [What is Node](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-node)

As for using Node, that's outside the scope of this tutorial and I recommend putting it off until you have a better grasp on the basics of JS.

Here’s a quick guide to installing Node.js on your computer if you want to tinker with it, though you likely won’t mess with Node for quite a while.

- [How to use Node Package Manager](https://nodesource.com/blog/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-using-npm/)

You can download the full Node compiler here.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

# Git

Git is used by nearly every programmer for a collaborative work environment and source control. It allows dev teams to work together harmoniously by providing a cloud shared repository for your projects, as well as a slew of other benefits. Learn to love git, you'll be using it every day!

> **Note:** Git and GitHub are not the same thing! Git was developed and maintained by Linus Torvalds (creator of linux) as a version control system (VCS) to help better maintain software in larger teams. 

> On the other hand, Github (and other similar hosting platforms) work in conjunction with Git to host the changes made on the Git VCS. Think of GitHub as a better UI than simply using the terminal, while Git is the pipeline that handles all of the information (requests, branches, commits, etc).

This is a fantastic tutorial to get yourself quickly up to speed on what Git is and how to use it. For most beginners, all you really need to know is 5 simple commands.
