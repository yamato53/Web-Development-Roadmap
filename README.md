# web-development-roadmap

A light weight repository of free web development resources, tools and tutorials.

>**Note:** I'll continue to expand on this repository with helpful links, tools, tutorials and insights that I find along the way.

# Getting Started

For starters, I'd recommend taking a look at the broad overview of web development. I've found this resource, [Front End Handbook](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/), to be the most comprehensive breakdown of front-end web development. While it doesn’t provide direct links to resources on a lot of things, it lays out exactly what you need to know and even recommends the order in which to begin learning.
  
Don’t get overwhelmed looking at the list, it’s easier than it looks and you’ll pick up a lot of it along the way.
That being said, here's my personal recommendation on where to begin:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Chrome Dev Tools. (right click on a web page -> inspect)
4. The DOM (How websites are built)
5. JavaScript Basics

Learning HTML, CSS and your browser's development tools is fairly easy, and fundamental in your journey towards building websites. 

Heck, by just fiddling around with Chrome's Dev Tools I was able to have a fairly solid understanding of HTML and CSS before I even took classes on them.


> **Note:** A lot of the content here is going to overlap - that's a good thing. You'll likely find yourself repeating the very basics of web development (particularly JS) over and over until you finally have those key lightbulb moment. That same "Aha!" moment will happen again and again until you finally have a firm grasp on the subjects at hand.

# What You’ll Need

There’s a large variety of tools available that make writing code and keeping your projects organized. You'll commonly hear these referred to as IDEs (Independant Development Environments) or code editors. An IDE can have a big impact on how comfortable you are while coding, so make sure to try out a few different options to find what works best for you.


Personally, I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as this is the industry standard with over 63% of programmers using in on both their professional and personal projects. If you want something a bit less complex and heavy-duty, here's a few other options to check out.

- Atom
- Sublime Text
- Codepen (online code editor)
- JSfiddle (online code editor)

# HTML Resources

Starting with the easiest of the "core three" skills, we have HTML. I always recommend Codecademy to total beginners as they do a good job holding your hand throught he very basics of HTML within a contained environment (you write all the code within their site). Of course, if you already have a bit of HTML know-how, I'd suggest skipping this and going straight to [Interneting is Hard](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/).

- [Codecademy HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)

While Codecademy isn't the best place to learn how all of these different puzzle pieces link together, it does do a great job laying out the basic foundation for you.

# CSS Resources

CSS is (in my utterly useless opinion) the easiest and most entertaining part of web development. Again, I recommend starting with codecademy’s stuff because it’s very basic.

- [Codecademy CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)

After you’ve finished with Codecademy's tutorials, head on over to this short series of tutorials. They do a great job laying out how HTML and CSS link together. Aside from teaching great fundamental skills, they go over a lot of website best practices and other dos and don’ts that will save you from many common mistakes beginner devs make.

## CSS - Learn Flexbox

Flexbox is the foundation for modern web development and allows for easy manipulation of block elements. Here's a great tutorial on how exactly flexbox works.

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

If you ever need a reminder on how a certain flexbox element works, there's a fantastic Codepen playground setup to test different styles.

# JavaScript Resources

JavaScript is where things start to get interesting. Why? Because code is fundamentally different than anything else you’ve done before. By that I mean, computers work on a series of 1's and 0's, yes and nos, if's and else's. As such, it's difficult (at first) to wrap your head around the basic idea of why code is written the way it is. 

With that said, I’d start here.

- [Codecademy JS Basics](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

Yet again, Codecademy is a decent resource for absolute beginners that won’t bog you down. For now, just learn the syntax and don’t worry about how your code will actually be implemented in the real world.

Next, do this series of videos, they are by-far the best series of tutorials I’ve found that teaches you real-world application of the JS syntax and code you'll be writing.

- [Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript)

After you’ve finished the series, I recommend reading the Eloquent JS ebook. He does a good job explaining the computer science behind JS without overloading you with too much random jargon.

- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

After that, I’d read this series of ebooks, it’s fantastic about grilling in some of the really complicated things about JS.

- [You Don't Know JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

# Node Resources

Node is the compiler that allows JavaScript to actually run. You don’t really need to learn about this until much later, but it doesn’t hurt to know what it actually is as you'll be hearing the name a lot.

This is a good, simple breakdown of what node is.

- [What is Node](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-node)

As for using Node, that's outside the scope of this tutorial and I recommend putting it off until you have a better grasp on the basics of JS.

Here’s a quick guide to installing Node.js on your computer if you want to tinker with it, though you likely won’t mess with Node for a quite a while.

- [How to use Node Package Manager](https://nodesource.com/blog/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-using-npm/)

You can download the full Node compiler here.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

# Git

Git is the primary form of source control and colaberative work-space for pretty much every company that works with code of nearly any type. It easily allows you to maintain source control, keep backups, stay synced and leave a bread-trail of changes in a multi-team project.

> **Note:** Git and GitHub (or GitLab) are not the same thing. Git was developed and maintained by Linus Torvalds (creator of linux) as a VCS to make colaberative programming easy and simple. On the otherhand, Github (and other similar hosting platforms) work in conjunction with Git to host the changes made on the Git VCS. Think of GitHub as the cloud which displays and distributes information, while Git is the pipeline which sends the data between users and the cloud.

This is a fantastic tutorial to get yourself quickly up to speed on what Git is and how to use it. To put it simply, it's about 5 commands in DOS.
